# __NOTES and IMPONDERABILIA:__

### Jupyter Notebooks in this folder were originally created and run in the main directory. They were moved here to reduce clutter. If you wish to play with them move them back first!



## __Useful Links:__

## __Running Questions:__

It seems only one notebook can run at a time . . .
* ? Is it necessary to restart the jupyter with spark to run another notebook?

Should CountVectorizer be run on the whole dataset all at once,
or separately on the test and training set?

Is there a way to import/use a corpus in Spark NLP?
