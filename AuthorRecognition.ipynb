But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for.

And even\\nScrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was\\nan excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and\\nsolemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\",\n",
